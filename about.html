            <p>People are emotional beings, not rational ones, and for this reason, the first impression matters more than we think or than we want. That's why you maybe need some guidance in managing your social media accounts, especially if you have a business.</p>

            <h2>How can we help you?</h2>

            <p>You will come mainly with the idea of the post... we will just tell you at what time to publish it to have the most coverage, how to edit the picture to respect a certain chromatic and many more. Also, in the long term, we will analyze what caught the public better, we will present it to you and we will try to maintain this trend. Otherwise, we will come up with suggestions to fix the problems.</p>
